	* 3.3.2 release.

	* One more ROOT-handling fix: finish configure gracefully if ROOT
	can't be found.

2009-03-30  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Build system fixes: handle case where ROOT is not present
	better, remove build flag duplication, proper propagation of
	CXXFLAGS variable for changing optimisation and debug mode.

2008-08-11  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Improvements to ROOT integration, including automatic ROOT path
	discovery (if root-config is in the user $PATH) and use of
	root-config to get the correct link flags.

	* General build robustness fixes.
